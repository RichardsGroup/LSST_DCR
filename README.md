We provide a code repository for computing a metric to investigate how measurements of differential chromatic refraction might influence choices for survey strategy in the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. __This branch contains the additional work that is presented/associated in/with the "LSST AGN SC Cadence Note: Differential Chromatic Refraction" submitted to LSST SCOC on April 15th 2021.__
